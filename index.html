        <p><em>Professional <strong>Web Developer</strong></em></p>
        <p>I am the Professional Writer who decided to became a WEB Developer and start the Professional life from the very beggining. Of course, I realise how difficult it will be.
          Anyway taking into account my previous life experience, it worth to say that I don`t affraid of challenges. I was strong enough to immigrate to a new country at the age of 36.
          As for my writing career you can check up my books in <a href="https://www.litres.ru/mihail-rybka/">the Internet</a>.
